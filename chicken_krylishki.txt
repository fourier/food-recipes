Ingredients:

1 kg chicken tights de-boned (kycklingsl√•rfile),

1 lemon,

2 big oranges or 3 small,

1 garlic clove,

1/2 fresh chili,

Black Pepper,

Salt

- Wash and cut the chicken meat in pieces and put them in a large pan with some olive oil or butter;

- Let them cook without lid in moderate/high heat;

- Squeeze the oranges and the lemon;

- When all the water has disappeared and the meat has got a light brown color (it takes about 20
minutes) add the garlic (squashed), some black pepper, some salt and the chili (chopped);

- Steer for 1-2 minutes making sure the meat does not get burned; this is done to let the meat absorb the
spices flavors;

- Add the lemon and orange juice;

- Adjust the salt;

- Cover with a lid;

- Lower the heat to low but make sure that the liquid is simmering;

- Let it cook for 20-30 minutes (until the liquid has become a kind of sauce);

I usually serve this dish with some basmati rice.
